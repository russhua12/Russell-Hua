Research Interests and Past Work

My primary research interest lies in partial differential equations (PDE), especially those arising from physics and geometric aspects. Below is a truthful record of a significant portion of my previous work during my master’s at MCAM at the University of Chicago and my undergraduate studies at Rutgers University.

Past Projects

In the “Past Projects” folder, you will find files related to all my previous work, including:

	•	“Relax Functional With Mild Perturbation”
	•	“Some Geometric Inequalities” (Undergraduate Thesis)
	•	“Geometry and Topology Qual Guideline”
	•	“Dirac and Schrödinger Equations with Cubic Nonlinearities” (Master’s Thesis)
	•	“Fourier Analysis and Its Applications” (Summer REU)
	•	“Homoclinic Bifurcation Theorem, Some Remarks”

Course Notes

In files starting with a topic or class name, you will find PDF notes (if applicable). These files also include proof of official auditor status, course syllabi, and class notes for many courses not listed on my transcript due to credit constraints and prerequisites.

Approach to Mathematical Maturity

My professors have varied in their advice: some recommend gaining mathematical maturity through diverse fields, while others insist on specializing deeply in one direction. My approach focuses on PDE-related topics as the main line of inquiry, branching out into various areas that arise from this foundation. As a result, I have been exposed to:

	•	Analysis track
	•	Geometric analysis
	•	Variation method
	•	Probability track
	•	Topology, including algebraic topology
