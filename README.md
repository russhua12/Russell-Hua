Research Interests and Past Work:

My primary research interest lies in partial differential equations (PDE), especially those arising from physics and geometric aspects. Below is a truthful record of a significant portion of my previous work during my master’s at MCAM at the University of Chicago and my undergraduate studies at Rutgers University.

Past Projects:

In the “Past Projects” folder, you will find files related to all my previous work, including:

	•	“Relax Functional With Mild Perturbation” (Course Project)
	•	“Existence of Scattering Solution to the Weakly Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NLS)” (Master’s Thesis)
	•	“Fourier Analysis and Its Applications” (Summer REU)
	•	“Homoclinic Bifurcation Theorem, Some Remarks”
 	•	“Geometry and Topology Qual Guideline”
 	•	“Remarks on Global Convergence of Yamabe Flow in 3D Sphere” (Undergrad Thesis)
  

Course Notes:

In files starting with a topic or class name, you will find PDF notes (if applicable). These files also include proof of official auditor status, course syllabi, and class notes for many courses not listed on my transcript due to credit constraints and prerequisites.

Approach to Mathematical Maturity:

My professors have varied in their advice: some recommend gaining mathematical maturity through diverse fields, while others insist on specializing deeply in one direction. My approach focuses on PDE-related topics as the main line of inquiry, branching out into various areas that arise from this foundation. As a result, I have been exposed to:

	•	Analysis track
	•	Geometric analysis
	•	Variation method
	•	Probability track
	•	Topology, up to algebraic topology
